# The Abstract Factory Design Pattern

The _abstract factory_ design pattern solves the following problem:

 * Your application code needs to create instances of type X.
 * Type X is an interface (or an abstract class), and might have different concrete implementations.
 * Your application code should __not__ depend on any specific implementation.

As usual, we will develop our solution one step at a time.     
Let's start from [step 1](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/AbstractFactoryExample/tree/step1).
